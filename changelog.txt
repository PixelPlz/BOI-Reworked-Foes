Version 3.1.0

-- Additions --
- Added DSS toggles for pretty much everything!
	- NOTE: The mod now uses a new system to store the config so previous settings have been reset
	and any other mod wanting to do compatibility should also update to use these variables (this is the price you have to pay for wanting this)
	Because of how the reworks are handled, the bestiary won't show this mod's sprites for most enemies and bosses.
